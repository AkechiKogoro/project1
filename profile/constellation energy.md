#### 1 Project Description

a. Initial Involvement

I was brought in to lead and modernize the data infrastructure, leveraging my expertise with big data technologies to enhance data processing capabilities and infrastructure resilience.

b. State Upon Arrival

Upon my arrival, the application and production environments were operational but not optimized. There were significant inefficiencies in data processing, and the existing infrastructure was not fully leveraging cloud capabilities.

c. Application Functionality

The application was a complex data processing system that integrated various data sources for real-time analytics and reporting to support business decisions in energy management and distribution.

d. End Users

The end users were internal teams within Constellation Energy Corporation, including the business analytics, risk management, and operations teams.

e. Feature Implementation

I implemented features such as real-time data streaming with Kafka, and optimized data warehousing with Apache Hive. This involved rewriting existing ETL processes to be more efficient and scalable.

f. Leadership and Coding Time

I spent about 60% of my time leading the team and strategizing, and 40% on hands-on coding and technical implementations.

g. Challenges and Solutions

In the production environment, we faced challenges with data latency and throughput. I addressed these by implementing Apache Kafka for real-time data streaming and optimizing Apache Spark jobs for better performance.

h. Team Size and Roles

The team consisted of 15 members, including junior data engineers, data analysts, and cloud infrastructure specialists.

i. Day-to-Day Management

I managed the day-to-day operations using Agile methodologies, with tools like JIRA for task management, and Confluence for maintaining rigorous documentation standards.

j. Testing Environment

The testing environment was robust, with continuous integration setups using Jenkins. We used automated testing frameworks to ensure code quality.

k. Meetings and Scrum

Weekly stand-ups included all team members, where we discussed ongoing tasks, blockers, and sprint goals. I ran the scrum meetings focusing on transparency and quick resolution of issues.

#### 2 Major Tangible Contributions

a. Tools and Decision-Making

I used tools like Cloudera for Hadoop, AWS for cloud infrastructure, and Tableau for data visualization. Decisions were often based on scalability, cost, and performance considerations.

b. Architecture Decisions

The system architecture was designed to be scalable and resilient, using AWS services and Cloudera's distribution. Trade-offs included balancing cost with performance, especially when choosing between on-premise and cloud solutions.

c. Layout and User Experience

For internal tools like dashboards, I ensured that the user interface was intuitive and met the specific needs of different internal teams, enhancing their productivity and decision-making capabilities.

d. Requirement Gathering

I held regular meetings with stakeholders to ensure all requirements were clearly understood and met. This involved detailed discussions with department heads to align the data infrastructure with business objectives.

e. Feature Implementation Details

Features like real-time data analytics were implemented using Kafka and Spark, which involved redesigning the data ingestion pipelines and integrating them with existing data warehouse solutions.

f. Adherence to SDLC

The Software Development Life Cycle was strictly followed, with clear phases from planning to deployment and maintenance, ensuring all standards were met.

g. QA and Testing

Testing strategies included unit testing, integration testing, and performance testing, primarily using automated test suites to ensure a bug-free production environment.


h. Learning and Integration

I quickly acclimated to the existing codebase and technologies by conducting thorough reviews and collaborating with incumbent team members.

i. User Feedback Improvement

Regularly reviewed user feedback to identify areas for improvement, ensuring that the application met the highest standards of user satisfaction.

j. Addressing Bugs

I prioritized existing bugs based on their impact on the system and addressed them systematically to stabilize the application.

k. Task Prioritization

I managed the backlog by prioritizing tasks that aligned with our strategic goals, focusing first on those that supported our MVP.

l. Best Practices in Coding

Re-defined coding practices to adhere to OOP principles, enhancing maintainability and scalability of our applications.

#### 3 Technical Failure Example

A significant technical failure occurred when a data corruption issue impacted our real-time streaming service. I led the team in a root cause analysis, which revealed a misconfiguration in Kafka consumers. We rectified the issue by overhauling our data validation processes and implementing stricter monitoring protocols. Key learning: always ensure thorough testing and monitoring of real-time data systems.

#### 4 Comprehensive Project Overview

I was hired to overhaul and enhance the data processing and analytics capabilities. Upon joining, I found the systems underperforming and not fully integrated with modern cloud services. By leading a team of 15, we enhanced the system using technologies like Cloudera, Kafka, and AWS. We resolved significant performance bottlenecks, leading to more robust and scalable infrastructure. Deliverables included a set of new data processing pipelines, comprehensive documentation, and a series of performance optimization reports.
