1. Project Overview and Your Role

a. Initial Involvement: You were brought into Oscar Health primarily to strengthen the technical aspects of cybersecurity by leveraging advanced big data technologies to enhance analytics capabilities.


b. State Upon Arrival: The existing cybersecurity system was not equipped to handle the complexity of data or provide real-time analysis. It needed significant upgrades both in technology and processing capabilities.


c. Application Description: The application was a cybersecurity analytics platform designed to monitor, analyze, and react to potential threats in real-time, enhancing the companyâ€™s security infrastructure.

d. End Users: The primary users were the cybersecurity team at Oscar Health who used the platform to actively monitor network traffic and respond to threats.

e. Specific Implementations: Your technical contributions included:

- Integrating Apache Kafka for real-time data streaming.

- Optimizing Cloudera Hadoop setups for efficient data processing.

- Developing machine learning models for anomaly detection and threat prediction.

f. Time Allocation: 

About 20% of your time was spent on coordination and planning, with the remaining 80% dedicated to coding and technical developments.

g. Challenges and Solutions:

- Data Handling: 

    Managed the high data volume by optimizing Kafka and Hadoop configurations for better throughput and reliability.

- Integration Challenges: 

    Ensured smooth integration of new machine learning models into the existing data pipeline by thorough testing and continuous monitoring.

h. Team Composition: 

The team included 10 members with roles such as data engineers, machine learning specialists, and cybersecurity analysts.

i. Management Practices:

Prioritized hands-on technical tasks and participated in Agile sprints, focusing on rapid delivery of new features.

Used Git for version control, with an emphasis on regular commits and maintaining a clean codebase.

j. Testing Environment:

Led the setup of automated testing frameworks that included unit and integration tests to ensure the reliability of new features.

Practiced continuous integration with Jenkins to manage and deploy updates efficiently.

k. Meetings and Scrum:

Participated in weekly scrum meetings to discuss technical challenges, progress on current tasks, and planning next steps.

Contributed to discussions by providing updates on technical developments and receiving input on potential security concerns.

#### Tangible Contributions

- Tool Selection and Implementation: 

    Chose and implemented appropriate big data tools (Hadoop, Kafka) to manage data scale and real-time processing needs effectively.

- System Architecture: 

    Played a key role in re-architecting the data processing pipeline to accommodate real-time analysis and machine learning integration.

- Feature Development: 

    Focused on developing and tuning machine learning models that significantly improved the detection of anomalies in network traffic.

#### 3 Technical Failure and Resolution

- Incident: 

    During a routine update, a misconfiguration in Kafka led to a temporary loss of data streaming capabilities. 

- Resolution: 

    Quickly identified and corrected the configuration issue, then implemented a new protocol for update reviews to prevent similar issues. 

- Key Learning: 

    The incident underscored the importance of rigorous testing and review processes, especially in real-time operational environments.
