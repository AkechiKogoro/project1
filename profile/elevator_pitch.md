Hi, I’m Yesheng Huang, a Senior Big Data Engineer with over 11 years of experience in Big Data and 14 years in IT.

For the past year at Huntington Bancshares, I’ve led the development of data assets on Google Cloud Platform. My role involved managing end-to-end data pipelines, integrating real-time streaming with Kafka, and automating CI/CD processes to ensure seamless operations. I also worked closely with cross-functional teams to deliver data products and services for external stakeholders. Before this, I developed and deployed Big Data analytics solutions on AWS at AbbVie, focusing on pharmacovigilance data.

I’m skilled in Google Cloud, AWS, and Azure, with hands-on experience in tools like Apache Spark, Hadoop, Kafka, and Snowflake. My programming strengths include Python, Scala, and SQL, and I’m proficient in CI/CD practices with Jenkins and Airflow.
